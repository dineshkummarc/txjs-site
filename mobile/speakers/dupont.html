<h3>How Custom Events will Save the Universe</h3>
<p>All the major frameworks support custom events. All framework authors love custom events and want you to use them. But few people actually do.</p>
<p>Custom events aren’t a gimmick. The ability to fire your own events — just like the browser fires click, mousemove, focus, and all the rest — can solve many of the problems large JS projects face.</p>
<p>We’ll look at a handful of recipes for integrating custom events into your own code. You’ll learn how to fire custom events in each of the major JavaScript frameworks, and explore the advantages that custom events have over a standard callback pattern.</p>

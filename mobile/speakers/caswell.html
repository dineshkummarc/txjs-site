<h2>Tim Caswell</h2>
<p>Tim has extensive experience in the world of building web-based applications. After about a 10-year stint working with the standard PHP + HTML + JavaScript + SQL stack, he quit it all to spend his time pushing the envelope of what’s possible. It wasn’t until he decided to dig in and do JavaScript the right way that he learned JavaScript is the real language of the open web. </p>
<p>Tim lives near Dallas, Texas, USA. When he’s not up all night working on his latest pet project, he likes to play with his two kids, go camping, and ride his three-wheeled scooter around town.</p>
<h3>Writing a Real-Time Game with NodeJS</h3>
<p>Thanks to the hard work of the people at CommonJS and Ryan Dahl’s work on NodeJS, server-side JavaScript is not only a possibility, but a remarkable way to make simple, fast servers. We’ll start by quickly going over the architecture of NodeJS, explaining why it’s both fast and simple at the same time. We’ll discuss the benefits of the single threaded model and why you should care. Then, we’ll shift gears and walk through building the back end to a real-time multi-player game that uses the latest and greatest technologies in the browser. We’ll go over various techniques needed to manage code complexity, and the high-level concepts used to keep several players on different browsers in sync with each-other.</p>

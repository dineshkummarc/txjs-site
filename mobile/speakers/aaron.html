<h3>Special Events: Beyond Custom Events</h3>
<p>Working with events is just part of working with the web. Events help us keep track of what our users are doing and what our server is sending us, and allow one part of our app to communicate with another part. jQuery’s event system is flexible and intuitive, letting you handle both DOM and custom events with the same API. What if you could hook directly into jQuery’s event system to add functionality to events as they are bound and unbound? You could create some pretty awesome and complex custom events, and you can do it with jQuery right now using Special Events. Learn how to create events that go beyond the standard custom event.</p>

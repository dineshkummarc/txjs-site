<h2>Dan Webb</h2>
<p>Dan is a front-end engineer at Twitter and one of the developers of @anywhere, Twitter’s client-side framework. He maintains a number of open source projects, including Low Pro, a progressive enhancement framework for jQuery and Prototype; Restler, a powerful REST client for NodeJS; and Sumo, an extensible microformats parser for JavaScript. He also runs twaud.io — it’s like twitpic but for audio. When not staring at a laptop he DJs, drinks too much beer and collects sneakers.</p>
<h3>Building @anywhere: 
A Client-side Interface to Twitter</h3>
<p>@anywhere is a platform which provides developers with the ability to create fully featured Twitter applications from pure client-side JavaScript. This presentation will quickly introduce @anywhere then dive into what it took to build the platform. We’ll talk cross-domain communication, client-only authentication and security, iframes (oh, the iframes!) and lots more in order to explain what it took to provide Twitter’s API over pure JavaScript and how you could use similar techniques to expose a pure-JavaScript interface to your web application.</p>

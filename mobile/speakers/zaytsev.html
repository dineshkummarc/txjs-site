<h3>Dive into ECMAScript 5</h3>
<p>The 5th edition of ECMAScript (ES5) is the new, shiny version of ECMAScript standard — a standard that defines what we affectionately call “Javascript.” Officially completed only few months ago, ECMAScript 5 brings a slew of exciting new features, along with changes to existing functionality.
We’ll dive into ECMAScript 5 to find out what makes it awesome. We’ll talk about the new model of “meta” attributes, and how it allows us to create more robust code. We’ll also look at the new strict mode, additions to built-in methods, and fixes to some of the annoying features of previous editions.</p>

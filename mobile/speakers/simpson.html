<h3>Web Performance & UI Architecture</h3>
<p>We all know that web performance optimization is becoming critical to the success of web sites and applications. The problem is, we often don’t have the control over the UI Architecture (“middle-end”) that we need to really make things better.</p>
<p>We’ll talk about how to use JavaScript (client- and server-side) to revamp the middle-end so we can throttle web performance (and code maintainability) to the next level.</p>

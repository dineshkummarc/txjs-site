<h2>Alex Sexton</h2>
<p>Alex is a Labs Engineer at Bazaarvoice in Austin. As a Texas native, Alex enjoys a tasty brisket while writing JavaScript apps that even Sam Houston would be proud of. He is a co-host of the yayQuery podcast and would implore you to listen to it. He is also the creator of the most popular implementation of ‘goto’ in JavaScript, much to Davy Crockett’s chagrin. Alex can be found blogging at alexsexton.com and tweeting as @SlexAxton.</p>

This talk covers the hacks, tips, and tricks to leave the Same Origin Policy in the dust. So grab a cookie, pad your JSON, and learn how to communicate properly.</p>

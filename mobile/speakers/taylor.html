<h3>Regressive Enhancement, or HTML5 for crappy browsers</h3>
<p>Learn how to use JavaScript in conjunction with feature detection to take advantage of the new semantic elements provided by HTML5 (i.e., &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;), as well as emulate the new input types (i.e., type=date, type=range) and input attributes (i.e., autofocus, list, pattern), in a cross-browser, future-proof fashion. As examples, we’ll walk through the creation of a few example jQuery plugins ($.fn.autofocus, $.fn.placeholder, $.fn.datalist).</p>
<p>The primary focus will not be the specific mechanics of these example plugins, but rather how to use JavaScript as a stopgap solution while browser vendors work on implementing native support for these new features.</p>
<p>Alas, using HTML5 today is not all magic and ponies — there are certain risks. As such, this talk also discusses the pitfalls of using these new elements and features in today’s most popular browsers with partial or no HTML5 support (what’s up, Internet Explorer!), including AJAX, CSS (for screen and print media), and interacting with the DOM via jQuery.</p>

<h3>Front End Abstractions at Facebook</h3>
<p>Facebook has seen incredible growth over the past few years and has over 400 million active users. In order to face some of the challenges that come with such tremendous growth, we’ve developed advanced abstractions around our front end infrastructure. These systems allow us to write more modular code, serve pages faster, provide our users with a better experience, and save money.</p>
<p>I’ll cover some of these abstractions like Haste, Primer, Quickling, PageCache, and BigPipe, in order to paint a better picture of how Facebook works, and give the audience some ideas of how to architect their own systems around technologies that have proven to be successful for Facebook.</p>
